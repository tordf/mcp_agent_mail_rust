## TL;DR

**The Problem**: Modern projects often run multiple coding agents at once (backend, frontend, scripts, infra). Without a shared coordination fabric, agents overwrite each other's edits, miss critical context from parallel workstreams, and require humans to relay messages across tools and teams.

**The Solution**: Agent Mail gives every coding agent a persistent identity (e.g., `GreenCastle`), an inbox/outbox, searchable threaded conversations, and advisory file reservations (leases) to signal editing intent. Everything is backed by Git for human-auditable artifacts and SQLite for fast indexing and search.

### Why Use Agent Mail?

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Advisory File Reservations** | Agents declare exclusive or shared leases on file globs before editing, preventing conflicts with a pre-commit guard |
| **Asynchronous Messaging** | Threaded inbox/outbox with subjects, CC/BCC, acknowledgments, and importance levels |
| **Token-Efficient** | Messages stored in a per-project archive, not in agent context windows |
| **34 MCP Tools** | Infrastructure, identity, messaging, contacts, reservations, search, macros, product bus, and build slots |
| **11-Screen TUI** | Real-time dashboard, message browser, thread view, agent roster, search, reservations, metrics, health, timeline, projects, and contacts |
| **Robot Mode** | 16 agent-optimized CLI subcommands with `toon`/`json`/`md` output for non-interactive workflows |
| **Git-Backed Archive** | Every message, reservation, and agent profile stored as files in per-project Git repos |
| **Hybrid Search** | Search V3 via frankensearch with lexical, semantic, and hybrid routing |
| **Pre-Commit Guard** | Git hook that blocks commits touching files reserved by other agents |
| **Dual-Mode Interface** | MCP server (`mcp-agent-mail`) and operator CLI (`am`) share tools but enforce strict surface separation |

### Quick Example

```bash
# Install and start (auto-detects all installed coding agents)
am

# That's it. Server starts on 127.0.0.1:8765 with the interactive TUI.

# Agents coordinate through MCP tools:
#   ensure_project(project_key="/abs/path")
#   register_agent(project_key, program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")
#   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
#   send_message(project_key, from_agent, to_agent, subject="Starting refactor", thread_id="FEAT-123")
#   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)

# Or use the robot CLI for non-interactive agent workflows:
am robot status --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake
am robot inbox --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --urgent --format json
am robot reservations --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --conflicts
```

### What Agent Conversations Look Like

Example exchange between two agents coordinating a refactor:

No human relay needed. Agents negotiate file ownership, flag breaking changes in real time, and hand off work through structured, threaded messages stored in Git.

## Why This Exists

Modern projects often run multiple coding agents at once (backend, frontend, scripts, infra). Without a shared coordination fabric, agents overwrite each other's edits, miss critical context from parallel workstreams, and require humans to relay messages across tools and teams.

Agent Mail was the first open-source agent coordination system that works across providers (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.), available since October 2025. You're going to hear about a lot of agent communication systems because it's such an obviously good idea, but Agent Mail sidesteps all the footguns that a naive implementation falls prey to. Combined with [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) and [bv](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer), it unlocks truly insane productivity gains.

### The Footguns Agent Mail Avoids

**No "broadcast to all" mode.** Agents are lazy and will default to broadcasting everything to everyone if you let them. That's like your email system at work defaulting to reply-all every time; it spams every agent with mostly irrelevant information and burns precious context.

**Obsessively refined API ergonomics.** Bad MCP documentation and poor agent ergonomics are the silent killers. It takes a huge amount of careful iteration, observation, and refinement to get the balance so tools just work reliably without wasting tokens. Agent Mail's 34 tool definitions have been through hundreds of rounds of real-world tuning.

**No git worktrees.** Worktrees demolish development velocity and create debt you need to pay later when the agents diverge. Working in one shared space surfaces conflicts immediately so you can deal with them, which is easy when agents can communicate. Instead of isolating agents, Agent Mail coordinates them.

**Advisory file reservations instead of hard locks.** There's a much better way to prevent conflicts than worktrees: agents call dibs temporarily on files while they're working on them, but it's not rigorously enforced, and reservations expire. Agents can observe if reserved files haven't been touched recently and reclaim them. You want a system that's robust to agents suddenly dying or getting their memory wiped, because that happens all the time. Hard locks would deadlock.

**Semi-persistent identity.** An identity that can last for the duration of a discrete task (for the purpose of coordination), but one that can also vanish without a trace and not break things. You don't want ringleader agents whose death takes down the whole system. Agent Mail identities are memorable (e.g., `GreenCastle`), but ephemeral by design.

**Graph-aware task selection.** If you have 200-500 tasks, you don't want agents randomly choosing them or wasting context communicating about what to do. There's usually a "right answer" for what each agent should work on, and that right answer comes from the dependency structure of the tasks. That's what [bv](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) computes using graph theory, like a compass that tells each agent which direction will unlock the most work overall.

### What Agent Mail Gives You

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs prevent agents from overwriting each other
- **Eliminates human liaisons:** Agents send messages directly to each other with threaded conversations, acknowledgments, and priority levels
- **Keeps communication off the token budget:** Messages stored in per-project Git archive, not consuming agent context windows
- **Offers quick reads:** `resource://inbox/{Agent}`, `resource://thread/{id}`, and 20+ other MCP resources
- **Provides full audit trails:** Every instruction, lease, message, and attachment is in Git for human review
- **Scales across repos:** Frontend and backend agents in different repos coordinate through the product bus and contact system

### Typical Use Cases

- Multiple agents splitting a large refactor across services while staying in sync
- Frontend and backend agent teams coordinating thread-by-thread across repositories
- Protecting critical migrations with exclusive file reservations and pre-commit guards
- Searching and summarizing long technical discussions as threads evolve
- Running agent swarms with [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) task tracking for dependency-aware work selection

### Productivity Math

One disciplined hour of AI coding agents often produces 10-20 "human hours" of work because the agents reason and type at machine speed. Agent Mail multiplies that: you invest 1-2 hours of human supervision, but dozens of agent-hours execute in parallel with clear audit trails and conflict-avoidance baked in. A single developer running Agent Mail + Beads + bv can ship what would normally take a team of engineers weeks.

## Design Philosophy

**Mail metaphor, not chat.** Agents send discrete messages with subjects, recipients, and thread IDs. Work coordination is structured communication with clear intent, not a firehose. Imagine if your email system at work defaulted to reply-all every time; that's what chat-based coordination does, and it burns context fast.

**Git as the source of truth.** Every message, agent profile, and reservation artifact lives as a file in a per-project Git repository. The entire communication history is human-auditable, diffable, and recoverable. SQLite is the fast index, not the authority.

**Advisory, not mandatory.** File reservations are advisory leases, not hard locks. The pre-commit guard enforces them at commit time, but agents can always override if needed. Deadlocks become impossible while accidental conflicts still get caught. Reservations expire on a TTL, so crashed agents don't hold files hostage forever.

**Resilient to agent death.** Agents die all the time: context windows overflow, sessions crash, memory gets wiped. Any agent can vanish without breaking the system. No ringleader agents, no single points of failure. Semi-persistent identities exist for coordination but don't create hard dependencies.

**Dual persistence.** Human-readable Markdown in Git for auditability; SQLite for indexing plus Search V3 for fast lexical/semantic retrieval. Both stay in sync through the write pipeline.

**Structured concurrency, no Tokio.** The entire async stack uses [asupersync](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync) with `Cx`-threaded structured concurrency. No orphan tasks, cancel-correct channels, and deterministic testing with virtual time.

---

## Rust vs. Python: Stress Test Results

The Python implementation had three recurring failure modes under real multi-agent workloads: Git lock file contention from concurrent writes, SQLite pool exhaustion under sustained load, and cascading failures when many agents hit the server simultaneously. The Rust rewrite was designed specifically to eliminate these, and a dedicated stress test suite proves it.

### The 10-Test Gauntlet

| Test | Result | Key Metrics |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 30-agent message pipeline | PASS | 150/150 success, p99=6.8s, 0 errors |
| 10-project concurrent ops | PASS | 150/150 success, 0 errors |
| Commit coalescer batching | PASS | 9.1x batching ratio (100 writes &rarr; 11 commits) |
| Stale git lock recovery | PASS | Lock detected, cleaned, writes resumed |
| Mixed reservations + messages | PASS | 80+80 ops, 0 errors |
| WBQ saturation | PASS | 2000/2000 enqueued, 0 errors, 0 fallbacks |
| Pool exhaustion (60 threads, pool=15) | PASS | 600/600 success, 0 timeouts, 24 ops/sec |
| Sustained 30s mixed workload | PASS | 1494 ops, ~49 RPS, p99=2.6s, 0 errors |
| Thundering herd (50 threads, 1 agent) | PASS | All 50 got same ID, 0 errors |
| Inbox reads during message storm | PASS | 150 sends + 300 reads, 0 errors |

### Python Problem &rarr; Rust Fix

| Python Failure Mode | What the Rust Tests Exercise | Result |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Git lock file contention** | Commit coalescer batching (100 concurrent writes &rarr; 11 commits, 9.1x reduction), stale lock recovery, multi-project isolation | 0 lock errors |
| **SQLite pool exhaustion** | 60 threads on pool of 15, sustained 50 RPS for 30s, thundering herd (50 threads &rarr; 1 agent) | 0 timeouts, 0 DB errors |
| **Overloading with many agents** | 30 agents &times; 5 messages, 10 projects &times; 5 agents, 2000 WBQ operations, mixed reservation+message workload | 0 errors across all |

### What Makes the Difference

- **Git lock contention eliminated.** The commit coalescer batches rapid-fire writes into far fewer git commits (9.1x reduction observed). Lock-free git plumbing commits avoid `index.lock` entirely in most cases.
- **Pool exhaustion handled gracefully.** Even with 4x more threads than pool connections (60 vs 15), all 600 operations succeeded with 0 timeouts. WAL mode + 60s `busy_timeout` lets writers queue rather than fail.
- **Stale lock recovery works.** Crashed-process lock files are detected via PID checking and cleaned up automatically, so a dead agent never holds the archive hostage.
- **Write-behind queue backpressure is clean.** 2000 rapid-fire enqueues from 20 threads &mdash; all accepted with 0 fallbacks or errors.
- **Read/write concurrency is solid.** Concurrent inbox reads and message writes produce 0 errors. WAL mode allows unlimited readers alongside writers.

The stress tests live in `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/tests/stress_pipeline.rs` (Rust unit tests targeting the DB+Git pipeline) and `tests/e2e/test_stress_load.sh` (HTTP E2E tests hammering a live server through the full network&rarr;server&rarr;DB&rarr;git pipeline).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the server

```bash
am
```

Auto-detects all installed coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, etc.), configures their MCP connections, and starts the HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8765` with the interactive TUI.

### 2. Agents register and coordinate

Once the server is running, agents use MCP tools to coordinate:

```
# Register identity
ensure_project(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo")
register_agent(project_key, program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")

# Reserve files before editing
file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)

# Send a message
send_message(project_key, from_agent="GreenCastle", to_agent="BlueLake",
             subject="Starting auth refactor", thread_id="FEAT-123", ack_required=true)

# Check inbox
fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
```

### 3. Use macros for common flows

```
# Boot a full session (register + discover inbox + check reservations)
macro_start_session(project_key, program, model)

# Prepare for a thread (fetch context + recent messages)
macro_prepare_thread(project_key, agent_name, thread_id)

# Reserve, work, release cycle
macro_file_reservation_cycle(project_key, agent_name, paths, ttl_seconds)

# Contact handshake between agents in different projects
macro_contact_handshake(from_project, from_agent, to_project, to_agent)
```

---

## Agent Configuration

The `am` command auto-detects installed agents, but you can also configure them manually.

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "mcp-agent-mail",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Or for HTTP transport (when the server is already running):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI

Add to `.codex/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "mcp-agent-mail",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Gemini CLI

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "mcp-agent-mail",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Any MCP-Compatible Client

Agent Mail supports both stdio and HTTP transports:

- **stdio**: Run `mcp-agent-mail` as a subprocess (the default for most MCP clients)
- **HTTP**: Connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/` when the server is running via `am` or `mcp-agent-mail serve`

---

## Server Modes

### MCP Server (default)

```bash
mcp-agent-mail                          # stdio transport (for MCP client integration)
mcp-agent-mail serve                    # HTTP server with TUI (default 127.0.0.1:8765)
mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui           # Headless server (CI/daemon mode)
mcp-agent-mail serve --reuse-running    # Reuse existing server on same port
```

### CLI Operator Tool

```bash
am                                      # Auto-detect agents, configure MCP, start server + TUI
am serve-http --port 9000               # Different port
am serve-http --host 0.0.0.0            # Bind to all interfaces
am serve-http --no-auth                 # Skip authentication (local dev)
am serve-http --path api                # Use /api/ transport instead of /mcp/
am --help                               # Full operator CLI
```

### Dual-Mode Interface

This project keeps MCP server and CLI command surfaces separate:

| Use case | Entry point | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| MCP server (default) | `mcp-agent-mail` | Default: MCP stdio transport. HTTP: `serve`. |
| CLI (operator + agent-first) | `am` | Recommended CLI entry point. |
| CLI via single binary | `AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli mcp-agent-mail` | Same CLI surface, one binary. |

Running CLI-only commands via the MCP binary produces a deterministic denial on stderr with exit code `2`, and vice versa, preventing accidental mode confusion in automated workflows.

### 20+ MCP Resources

Read-only resources for fast lookups without tool calls:

```
resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
resource://agents?project=<abs-path>
resource://reservations?project=<abs-path>
resource://metrics
resource://health
```

### Macros vs. Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros when you want speed** or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools when you need control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

## TUI Operations Console

The interactive TUI has 15 screens. Jump directly with `1`-`9`, `0` (screen 10), and shifted digits `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%` (screens 11-15). Use `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to cycle in order.

| # | Screen | Shows |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | Dashboard | Real-time operational overview with event stream and anomaly rail |
| 2 | Messages | Message browser with detail pane, presets, and compose/reply flows |
| 3 | Threads | Thread explorer and conversation drill-down |
| 4 | Agents | Agent roster with activity, state, and quick actions |
| 5 | Search | Unified multi-scope search with facets and preview |
| 6 | Reservations | File reservation status, conflicts, and create/release actions |
| 7 | Tool Metrics | Per-tool call counts, latency distributions, and failures |
| 8 | System Health | Probe/circuit/disk/memory diagnostics |
| 9 | Timeline | Events/Commits/Combined timeline views with inspector |
| 10 | Projects | Project inventory and routing helpers |
| 11 | Contacts | Contact links, policy view, and graph/mermaid modes |
| 12 | Explorer | Unified inbox/outbox explorer with direction and ack filters |
| 13 | Analytics | Anomaly insight feed with confidence and deep links |
| 14 | Attachments | Attachment inventory with preview and provenance |
| 15 | Archive Browser | Two-pane Git archive browser with tree + file preview |

**Global keys:** `?` help, `Ctrl+P`/`:` command palette, `/` global search focus, `.` contextual action menu, `Ctrl+N` compose overlay, `Ctrl+Y` toast-focus mode, `Ctrl+T`/`Shift+T` cycle theme, `m` toggle MCP/API transport, `q` quit.

**Screen-specific highlights:** Messages uses `g` for Local/Global inbox; Threads uses `e/c` for expand/collapse-all in conversation view; Timeline uses `V` for Events/Commits/Combined and `v` for visual selection; Search uses `f` + facet rail navigation for scope/sort/field controls; Contacts uses `n` for Table/Graph mode; batch-capable screens share `Space`/`v`/`A`/`C`; preset-enabled screens use `Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+L`.

**Command palette:** Press `Ctrl+P` (or `:` outside text-entry) to open a searchable action launcher that includes screen navigation, transport/layout controls, and dynamic entities (agents/projects/threads/tools/reservations).

**Themes:** Cyberpunk Aurora, Darcula, Lumen Light, Nordic Frost, High Contrast. Accessibility support includes high-contrast mode and reduced motion.
Archive Browser note: use `Enter` to expand/preview, `Tab` to switch tree vs preview pane, `/` to filter filenames, and `Ctrl+D/U` for preview paging.

- **`md`** (thread/message-focused): Human-readable narrative for deep context

### Agent Workflow Recipes

```bash
# Startup triage
am robot status --project /abs/path --agent AgentName

# Immediate urgency pass
am robot inbox --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --urgent --format json

# Incremental monitoring loop
am robot timeline --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --since 2026-02-16T10:00:00Z

# Deep thread drill-down
am robot thread br-123 --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --format md

# Reservation safety check before edits
am robot reservations --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --conflicts --expiring 30
```

---

## File Reservations for Multi-Agent Editing

Before editing, agents reserve file paths to avoid conflicts:

```
file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
```

The pre-commit guard (`mcp-agent-mail-guard`) installs as a Git hook and blocks commits that touch files reserved by other agents. Reservations are advisory, TTL-based, and support glob patterns.

| Area | Reserve glob |
|------|-------------|
| Core types/config | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/**` |
| SQLite layer | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/**` |
| Git archive | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/**` |
| Tool implementations | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/**` |
| TUI | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_*.rs` |
| CLI/launcher | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/src/**` |

## Multi-Agent Coordination Workflows

### How Agents Interact (Protocol Flow)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent A (GreenCastle)
    participant S as Agent Mail Server
    participant B as Agent B (BlueLake)

    A->>S: ensure_project("/abs/path")
    A->>S: register_agent(program="claude-code")
    S-->>A: identity: GreenCastle

    B->>S: register_agent(program="codex-cli")
    S-->>B: identity: BlueLake

    A->>S: file_reservation_paths(["src/auth/**"], exclusive=true)
    S-->>A: reserved ✓

    B->>S: file_reservation_paths(["src/auth/**"], exclusive=true)
    S-->>B: CONFLICT — reserved by GreenCastle

    B->>S: file_reservation_paths(["tests/api/**"], exclusive=true)
    S-->>B: reserved ✓

    A->>S: send_message(to=BlueLake, thread="FEAT-123", ack_required=true)
    S-->>B: new message in inbox

    B->>S: fetch_inbox()
    S-->>B: [message from GreenCastle]

    B->>S: acknowledge_message(message_id)
    S-->>A: ack received ✓

    A->>S: release_file_reservations(["src/auth/**"])
    S-->>A: released ✓
```

### Same Repository

1. **Register identity:** `ensure_project` + `register_agent` using the repo's absolute path as `project_key`
2. **Reserve files before editing:** `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`
3. **Communicate with threads:** `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`, check with `fetch_inbox`, acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`
4. **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`

### Across Different Repos

- **Option A (single project bus):** Register both repos under the same `project_key`. Keep reservation patterns specific (`frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
- **Option B (separate projects):** Each repo has its own `project_key`. Use `macro_contact_handshake` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` across repos.

### With Beads Task Tracking

Agent Mail pairs with [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for dependency-aware task selection:

1. **Pick ready work:** `br ready --json` (choose highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface:** `file_reservation_paths(..., reason="br-123")`
3. **Announce start:** `send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress
5. **Complete and release:** `br close 123`, `release_file_reservations(...)`, final Mail reply

Use the Beads issue ID (`br-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[br-123]` to keep everything linked.

---

## Browser State Sync Endpoint

For browser/WASM clients, Agent Mail exposes a polling-based state sync contract:

- `GET /mail/ws-state` returns a snapshot payload
- `GET /mail/ws-state?since=<seq>&limit=<n>` returns deltas since a sequence
- `POST /mail/ws-input` accepts remote terminal ingress events (`Input`, `Resize`)

Note: `/mail/ws-state` is intentionally HTTP polling, not WebSocket upgrade. WebSocket upgrade attempts return `501 Not Implemented`.

```bash
# Snapshot
curl -sS 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/mail/ws-state?limit=50' | jq .

# Delta from a known sequence
curl -sS 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/mail/ws-state?since=1200&limit=200' | jq .

# Input ingress (key event)
curl -sS -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/mail/ws-input' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"type":"Input","data":{"kind":"Key","key":"j","modifiers":0}}' | jq .
```

---

## Web UI

The server includes a lightweight, server-rendered web UI for humans at `/mail/`. Agents should continue using MCP tools and resources; the web UI is for human review and oversight.

### Routes

| Route | What You See |
|-------|-------------|
| `/mail/` | Unified inbox across all projects, project list, related project suggestions |
| `/mail/{project}` | Project overview with search, agent roster, quick links to reservations and attachments |
| `/mail/{project}/inbox/{agent}` | Reverse-chronological inbox for one agent with pagination |
| `/mail/{project}/message/{id}` | Full message detail with metadata, thread context, and attachments |
| `/mail/{project}/search?q=...` | Search V3-powered query route with field filters (`subject:foo`, `body:"multi word"`) |
| `/mail/{project}/file_reservations` | Active and historical file reservations |
| `/mail/{project}/attachments` | Messages with attachments |

Auth: set `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` for production. For local dev, set `HTTP_ALLOW_LOCALHOST_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` to browse without headers.

### Human Overseer

Sometimes you need to redirect agents mid-session. The **Overseer** compose form at `/mail/{project}/overseer/compose` lets humans send high-priority messages directly to any combination of agents.

Overseer messages:

- Come from a special `HumanOverseer` agent (program: `WebUI`, model: `Human`)
- Are always marked **high importance** so they stand out in agent inboxes
- Bypass normal contact policies so you can always reach any agent
- Include a preamble instructing agents to pause current work, handle the request, then resume

Agents see overseer messages in their normal inbox via `fetch_inbox` or `resource://inbox/{name}`. They can reply in-thread like any other message. Everything is stored identically to agent-to-agent messages (Git + SQLite), fully auditable.

---

## Deployment Validation

```bash
# Export a bundle
am share export -o /tmp/agent-mail-bundle --no-zip

# Verify a live deployment against the bundle
am share deploy verify-live https://example.github.io/agent-mail \
  --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle \
  --json > /tmp/verify-live.json

# Inspect verdict
jq '.verdict, .summary, .config' /tmp/verify-live.json
```

Exit codes: `0` = pass, `1` = fail.

---

## Configuration

All configuration via environment variables. The server reads them at startup via `Config::from_env()`.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Git-backed archive** for human auditability; SQLite as fast index
- **WAL mode** with PRAGMA tuning and connection pooling for concurrent access
- **Write-behind cache** with dual-indexed ReadCache and deferred touch batching (30s flush)
- **Async git commit coalescer** (write-behind queue) to avoid commit storms
- **i64 microseconds** for all timestamps (no `chrono::NaiveDateTime` in storage layer)
- **Search V3 via frankensearch** with lexical/semantic/hybrid routing and unified diagnostics
- **Conformance testing** against the Python reference implementation (23 tools, 23+ resources)
- **Advisory file reservations** with symmetric fnmatch, archive reading, and rename handling
- **`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`** across all crates
- **asupersync exclusively** for all async operations (no Tokio, reqwest, hyper, or axum)

```

### E2E Entrypoint Policy (T9.9)

- Native `am e2e` is authoritative for operator and CI invocation.
- `scripts/e2e_test.sh` remains compatibility-only and emits deprecation guidance.
- Rollback condition: set `AM_E2E_FORCE_LEGACY=1` only if native runner regression is confirmed.

Verification checklist:
- `am e2e list` and `am e2e run --project . <suite>` succeed for targeted suites.
- Artifact repro commands reference `am e2e run` (not script-first commands).
- CI/release docs and runbooks do not present `scripts/e2e_test.sh` as the primary command.

### Key Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `asupersync` | Structured async runtime (channels, sync, regions, HTTP, testing) |
| `fastmcp_rust` | MCP protocol implementation (JSON-RPC, stdio, HTTP transport) |
| `sqlmodel_rust` | SQLite ORM (schema, queries, migrations, pool) |
| `frankentui` | TUI rendering (widgets, themes, accessibility, markdown, syntax highlighting) |
| `frankensearch` | Hybrid search engine (lexical + semantic, two-tier fusion, reranking) |
| `beads_rust` | Issue tracking integration |
| `toon` | Token-efficient compact encoding for robot mode output |

## Mailbox Diagnostics (`am doctor`)

Over time, mailbox state can drift: stale locks from crashed processes, orphaned records, FTS index desync, expired reservations piling up. The `doctor` command group detects and repairs these issues.

```bash
# Run diagnostics (fast, non-destructive)
am doctor check
am doctor check --verbose
am doctor check --json          # Machine-readable output

# Repair (creates backup first, prompts before data changes)
am doctor repair --dry-run      # Preview what would change
am doctor repair                # Apply safe fixes, prompt for data fixes
am doctor repair --yes          # Auto-confirm everything (CI/automation)

# Backup management

```

What `check` inspects:

| Check | Detects |
|-------|---------|
| Locks | Stale `.archive.lock` / `.commit.lock` from crashed processes |
| Database | SQLite corruption via `PRAGMA integrity_check` |
| Orphaned records | Message recipients without corresponding agents |
| FTS index | Message count vs FTS index entry mismatch |
| File reservations | Expired reservations pending cleanup |
| WAL files | Orphan SQLite WAL/SHM files |

The repair command applies safe fixes (stale locks, expired reservations) automatically and prompts before data-affecting changes (orphan cleanup, FTS rebuild). A backup is always created before any modifications.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `"from_agent not registered"` | Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first |
| `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"` | Adjust patterns, wait for TTL expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation |
| Auth errors with JWT | Include bearer token with matching `kid` in the request header |
| Port 8765 already in use | `am serve-http --port 9000` or stop the existing server |
| TUI not rendering | Check `TUI_ENABLED=true` and that your terminal supports 256 colors |
| Empty inbox | Verify recipient names match exactly and messages were sent to that agent |
| Search returns nothing | Try simpler terms and fewer filters; inspect diagnostics in `search_messages` explain output |
| Pre-commit guard blocking | Check `am robot reservations --conflicts` for active reservations |

## Limitations

- **Rust nightly required.** Uses Rust 2024 edition features that require the nightly compiler.
- **Local workspace dependencies.** Building from source requires sibling directories for `fastmcp_rust`, `sqlmodel_rust`, `asupersync`, `frankentui`, `frankensearch`, `beads_rust`, and `toon_rust`.
- **Single-machine coordination.** Designed for agents running on the same machine or accessing the same filesystem. Not a distributed system.
- **Advisory, not enforced.** File reservations are advisory. Agents can bypass the pre-commit guard with `--no-verify`.
- **No built-in authentication federation.** JWT support exists, but there's no centralized auth service. Each server manages its own tokens.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from the Python version?**
A: This is a ground-up Rust rewrite with the same conceptual model but significant improvements: a 15-screen interactive TUI, robot mode CLI, hybrid search, build slots, the product bus for cross-project coordination, and substantially better performance. The conformance test suite ensures output format parity with the Python reference.

**Q: Do I need to run a separate server for each project?**
A: No. One server handles multiple projects. Each project is identified by its absolute filesystem path as the `project_key`.

**Q: How do agents get their names?**
A: Agent Mail generates memorable adjective+noun names (e.g., `GreenCastle`, `BlueLake`, `RedHarbor`) when agents register. Agents can also specify a name explicitly.

**Q: Can agents in different repos talk to each other?**
A: Yes. Use `request_contact` / `respond_contact` (or `macro_contact_handshake`) to establish a link between agents in different projects, then message directly. The product bus enables cross-project search and inbox queries.

**Q: Does this work with Claude Code's Max subscription?**
A: Yes. You can use a Max account with Agent Mail. Each agent session connects to the same MCP server regardless of subscription tier.

**Q: What happens if the server crashes?**
A: Git is the source of truth. SQLite indexes can be rebuilt from the Git archive. The commit coalescer uses a write-behind queue that flushes on graceful shutdown.

**Q: How does this integrate with Beads?**
A: Use the Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as the Mail `thread_id`. Beads owns task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail carries the conversations and audit trail. The installer can optionally set up Beads alongside Agent Mail.

## Ready-Made Blurb for Your AGENTS.md

Add this to your project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` to help agents use Agent Mail effectively:

```
## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations,
  with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases).
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (resource://inbox/..., resource://thread/...) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Register an identity: call ensure_project, then register_agent using this repo's
   absolute path as project_key.
2) Reserve files before you edit: file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name,
   ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
3) Communicate with threads: use send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123"); check inbox
   with fetch_inbox and acknowledge with acknowledge_message.
4) Quick reads: resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros for speed: macro_start_session, macro_prepare_thread,
  macro_file_reservation_cycle, macro_contact_handshake.
- Use granular tools for control: register_agent, file_reservation_paths, send_message,
  fetch_inbox, acknowledge_message.

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always register_agent in the correct project_key first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive.
```

## About Contributions

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
