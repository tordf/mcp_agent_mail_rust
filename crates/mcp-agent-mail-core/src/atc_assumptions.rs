//! Assumptions ledger, EV gates, and transparency cards for ATC learning (br-0qt6e.1.7).
//!
//! This module is the **reasoning contract** for the ATC learning stack. It
//! records *why* each mathematical method exists, *what assumptions* it makes,
//! *what evidence* would justify promoting or retiring it, and *how* operators
//! can inspect decisions after the fact.
//!
//! # Contract Scope
//!
//! Every mathematical method family used by ATC must have an entry in the
//! assumptions ledger ([`ASSUMPTIONS_LEDGER`]). Every entry carries an EV gate
//! ([`EvGate`]) that ties the method to a concrete user value. And every
//! material policy change must produce a transparency card ([`TransparencyCard`])
//! that operators can inspect in the TUI, robot output, or audit log.
//!
//! # How to Use This Module
//!
//! 1. **Before adding a new method**: Check [`ASSUMPTIONS_LEDGER`] for an
//!    existing family that already covers the need. If none applies, add a
//!    new [`AssumptionEntry`] with a complete EV gate before writing any code.
//!
//! 2. **Before promoting a method to production**: Verify that the evidence
//!    in [`EvGate::promotion_evidence`] has been collected and documented.
//!    If it has not, the method must remain behind a feature gate or shadow
//!    mode.
//!
//! 3. **Before retiring a method**: Check [`EvGate::sunset_evidence`] for the
//!    retirement trigger. If the evidence is present, remove the method and
//!    update the ledger entry's status to [`MethodStatus::Retired`].
//!
//! 4. **When a transparency card is emitted**: Verify it carries all required
//!    fields defined in [`TransparencyCard`]. Incomplete cards are a bug.
//!
//! # Anti-Complexity Guarantee
//!
//! The EV gate is the enforcing mechanism against math-for-math's-sake
//! complexity. A method that cannot fill in *all* fields of its [`EvGate`]
//! — especially `user_value`, `failure_it_prevents`, and `what_happens_without`
//! — is not justified and must not be added.
