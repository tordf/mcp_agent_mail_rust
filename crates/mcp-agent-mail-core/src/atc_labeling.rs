//! Outcome labeling automata and censoring rules for ATC learning (br-0qt6e.3.1).
//!
//! This module defines deterministic, machine-checkable rules for what counts
//! as success, failure, suppression, or censoring for each action family.
//! Without these rules the learning loop would drift into ad-hoc label noise.
//!
//! # Design Principles
//!
//! 1. **Execution truth, not intent**: Labels consume actual execution results
//!    and delayed evidence, not what ATC intended to do.
//!
//! 2. **Deterministic**: Given the same inputs, the automaton always produces
//!    the same label. No randomization, no fuzzy heuristics.
//!
//! 3. **Censoring over false precision**: When attribution is ambiguous
//!    (overlapping interventions, exogenous recovery, concurrent operator
//!    changes), the automaton censors rather than inventing a confident label.
//!
//! 4. **All paths labeled**: Acted, deliberately non-acted, safety-suppressed,
//!    throttled, and causally confounded paths all have explicit treatment.
//!
//! # Action Families
//!
//! Each [`EffectKind`] has its own labeling rules because the observable
//! outcomes differ:
//!
//! | Family             | Success Signal          | Failure Signal            |
//! |--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
//! | Probe              | Agent responds          | No response within window |
//! | Advisory           | Agent behavior changes  | No behavior change        |
//! | Release            | Released agent was dead  | Released agent was alive  |
//! | `ForceReservation` | Conflict resolved       | New conflict created      |
//! | `RoutingSuggestion`| Load rebalanced         | Load worsened             |
//! | Backpressure       | Queue depth drops       | Queue depth unchanged     |
//! | `NoAction`         | Situation stable        | Situation worsened        |
//!
//! # Attribution Windows
//!
//! Each action family defines how long to wait for outcome evidence before
//! censoring. These windows are tuned to balance learning speed against
//! attribution confidence.
