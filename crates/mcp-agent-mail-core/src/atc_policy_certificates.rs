#![allow(clippy::cast_precision_loss, clippy::doc_markdown)]
//! Safe policy-improvement certificates with doubly-robust off-policy
//! evaluation and anytime-valid confidence sequences (br-0qt6e.3.9).
//!
//! Policy promotion is the single highest-leverage and highest-blast-radius
//! adaptive move in the ATC design. This module defines the mathematical
//! certification layer that blocks promotion unless ATC can demonstrate,
//! with auditable evidence, that the candidate is better enough and safe
//! enough to replace the incumbent.
//!
//! # Certificate Lifecycle

//!
//! # Off-Policy Evaluation
//!
//! Uses the doubly-robust (AIPW) estimator for candidate-versus-incumbent
//! comparison:
//!
//! ```text
//!   DR(candidate) = (1/n) Σ_i [
//!       μ̂(candidate, x_i) +
//!       (A_i == candidate) / π(candidate | x_i) × (Y_i - μ̂(candidate, x_i))
//!   ]
//! ```
//!
//! where `μ̂` is the outcome model (mean loss estimate), `π` is the selection
//! probability (EXP3 distribution), and `Y_i` is the realized loss. This
//! estimator is doubly-robust: it remains consistent if *either* the outcome
//! model or the propensity model is correct.
//!
//! # Anytime-Valid Confidence Sequences
//!
//! Instead of fixed-sample confidence intervals, we use an e-process
//! (test martingale) that allows continuous monitoring with optional stopping:
//!
//! ```text
//!   E_t = Π_{i=1}^{t} (1 + λ × (Y_i - θ_0))
//!
//!   If E_t ≥ 1/α → reject null (candidate is better with level α)
//!   If 1/E_t ≥ 1/α → reject alternative (incumbent is better)
//! ```
//!
//! where `λ` is a tuning parameter (capital allocation) and `θ_0` is the
//! null hypothesis boundary (zero improvement). This provides sequential
//! validity: the certificate remains valid regardless of when we stop
//! collecting data.
//!
//! # Tail-Risk Protection
//!
//! A candidate cannot be promoted on mean utility alone. The certificate
//! also verifies:
//! - False-action rates per effect kind do not exceed budgets
//! - No single-window spike in loss exceeds the tail-risk threshold
//! - User-facing noise (advisory count, toast rate) stays within limits
//! - No safety regression on any tracked metric
