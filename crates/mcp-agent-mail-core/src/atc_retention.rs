//! Retention, compaction, and archive policy for ATC learning (`br-0qt6e.1.4`).
//!
//! This module is the canonical storage-lifecycle contract for the ATC
//! learning stack. It defines:
//!
//! - what stays hot in SQLite or the evidence ledger
//! - what is compacted into bounded rollups or batched audit summaries
//! - what is promoted into the Git archive
//! - what explicitly does **not** get archived by default
//! - what metadata must survive compaction so replay and forensics remain
//!   comparable over time
//!
//! # Temperature Model
//!
//! - **Hot**: full-fidelity rows or ledger entries used by live resolution and
//!   near-term debugging.
//! - **Warm**: compacted/derived state that still powers analysis without
//!   keeping raw telemetry forever.
//! - **Cold archive**: low-write, human-auditable artifacts stored in Git.
//! - **Dropped**: high-volume telemetry exhaust removed after its learning and
//!   forensic value has been preserved elsewhere.
//!
//! # Design Rules
//!
//! 1. Raw ATC experience history lives in SQLite, not Git.
//! 2. Open experiences are never compacted away while still unresolved.
//! 3. Rollups preserve learning signal after raw rows age out.
//! 4. Git stores explainability artifacts, not per-tick telemetry exhaust.
//! 5. Any archived artifact must remain comparable to a baseline, prior policy,
//!    or replay scenario without consulting chat history.
