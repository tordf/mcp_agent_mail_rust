//! Assumptions ledger, EV gate, and transparency cards for ATC learning
//! decisions (br-0qt6e.1.7).
//!
//! This module is the **reasoning contract** that keeps the ATC learning stack
//! auditable, understandable, and worth operating. Every mathematical method
//! family in the learning design is tied to:
//!
//! 1. **User value**: what problem it solves for operators and agents.
//! 2. **Assumptions**: what must hold for the method to be valid.
//! 3. **EV gate**: what expected-value evidence justifies its inclusion.
//! 4. **Sunset criteria**: what evidence would justify simplifying, disabling,
//!    or removing it.
//! 5. **Transparency cards**: structured audit data for operator visibility.
//!
//! # Design Principle
//!
//! Math-for-math's-sake complexity is the enemy. Every method family in the
//! ATC learning stack must earn its keep by demonstrating measurable
//! improvement over the frozen baseline ([`super::atc_baseline`]).
//!
//! # How to Use This Module
//!
//! 1. **Before adding a new method**: check [`MethodFamily`] — if none fits,
//!    define a new variant and fill out a [`MethodLedgerEntry`].
//! 2. **Before promoting a method to live**: verify it passes the
//!    [`EvGate`] criteria.
//! 3. **After a policy change**: emit a [`TransparencyCard`] so operators
//!    can audit why the change happened and what evidence supported it.
//! 4. **During periodic review**: check [`AssumptionStatus`] flags — any
//!    `Suspect` or `Invalidated` entry requires investigation.
