//! User-facing utility, remediation guidance, noise control, and safe
//! defaults for ATC surfaces (br-0qt6e.4.6).
//!
//! Defines how ATC communicates with operators and agents: what to show,
//! when to show it, how to frame actions vs. non-actions, and how to
//! keep the surface calm, fair, and trustworthy.
//!
//! # Design Principle
//!
//! Even a mathematically strong ATC system will feel bad if it is noisy,
//! opaque, hard to act on, or unable to say when the evidence is not
//! trustworthy. This module optimizes for real operators and agents.
//!
//! # Surface State Taxonomy
//!
//! Every ATC surface element must communicate one of these states:
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │  Observation        — "ATC noticed X. No action needed."    │
//! │  Recommendation     — "ATC suggests Y. Here's the evidence."│
//! │  Executed           — "ATC did Z. Here's why and what next."│
//! │  Suppressed         — "ATC held back. Here's why."          │
//! │  Fairness Throttle  — "Paused to avoid over-burdening."     │
//! │  Deliberate No-Op   — "ATC chose inaction. Here's why."     │
//! │  Distrust           — "Evidence quality too low to act on."  │
//! │  Confounded         — "Outcome is real but credit is unclear"│
//! │  Safe-to-Ignore     — "Nothing requires attention right now."│
//! └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! # Noise Control Philosophy
//!
//! The system should be informative without becoming spammy:
//! - Default surfaces show only actionable items
//! - Repeated identical messages are suppressed after the first
//! - Safe-no-action states are silent unless the operator drills down
//! - Escalation is visible but not alarming until action is needed
//! - Evidence-trust problems are surfaced honestly, not hidden
