//! Canonical experience tuple, lifecycle, and identifiers for ATC learning.
//!
//! This module defines the durable experience row that records what ATC did,
//! why, what happened next, and how future policy should change. It is the
//! foundational data-model contract for the ATC learning epic (br-0qt6e).
//!
//! # Identifier Model
//!
//! Each identifier serves a distinct correlation purpose:
//!
//! | ID               | Scope                        | Format            | Assigned by      |
//! |------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
//! | `experience_id`  | One experience row           | `exp-{u64}`       | Experience store |
//! | `decision_id`    | One ATC decision             | `dec-{u64}`       | Evidence ledger  |
//! | `effect_id`      | One effect plan              | `eff-{u64}`       | Effect planner   |
//! | `trace_id`       | One causal chain             | `trc-{fnv64}`     | Decision builder |
//! | `claim_id`       | One artifact-graph assertion | `clm-{u64}`       | Decision builder |
//! | `evidence_id`    | One evidence snapshot        | `evi-{u64}`       | Decision builder |
//!
//! A single decision can produce multiple effects. Each effect becomes its own
//! experience row, sharing the same `decision_id` and `trace_id` but having
//! distinct `experience_id` and `effect_id` values. This is the
//! one-decision-to-many-effect rule.

//! ## State Definitions
//!
//! | State        | Meaning                                                    |
//! |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Planned`    | Decision made, effect planned, not yet dispatched          |
//! | `Dispatched` | Effect handed to executor, outcome unknown                 |
//! | `Executed`   | Effect ran to completion (success or not)                  |
//! | `Failed`     | Effect dispatch or execution failed (infra/runtime error)  |
//! | `Throttled`  | Effect suppressed by rate-limit or budget constraint       |
//! | `Suppressed` | Effect blocked by safety gate (risk too high)              |
//! | `Skipped`    | Deliberate no-action: ATC decided inaction was optimal     |
//! | `Open`       | Executed but outcome not yet observed (delayed attribution)|
//! | `Resolved`   | Outcome observed and attributed to this experience         |
//! | `Censored`   | Outcome unobservable (agent departed, project closed, etc) |
//! | `Expired`    | Resolution window elapsed without observation              |
//!
//! ## Transition Rules
//!
//! - `Planned` is the initial state for all experience rows.
//! - `Planned → Dispatched`: Effect sent to executor.
//! - `Dispatched → Executed | Failed | Throttled | Suppressed | Skipped`:
//!   Terminal dispatch outcomes. These are set synchronously at dispatch time.
//! - `Executed → Open`: When the effect completed but the outcome is delayed.
//! - `Open → Resolved | Censored | Expired`: Terminal resolution states.
//!   Resolution is monotone: once terminal, the state never changes.
//! - `Skipped` is NOT a failure. It represents deliberate inaction where ATC
//!   determined that doing nothing was the best policy. Learning from skipped
//!   experiences is critical for validating conservative strategies.
//!
//! ## Idempotent Resolution
//!
//! Resolution transitions are idempotent: resolving an already-resolved
//! experience returns success without mutation. This guarantees that
//! duplicate outcome events (from retries, replays, or concurrent observers)
//! never corrupt the experience store.
