//! Authoritative mailbox durability state machine and invariants (br-97gc6.5.2.1.1).
//!
//! This module defines the single source of truth for mailbox durability
//! semantics across startup, doctor, CLI, and server entrypoints. The goal is
//! to stop each surface from inventing its own meaning for "stale",
//! "corrupt", or "recovering".
//!
//! # State Machine
//!
//! ```text
//! Healthy
//!   ├─ drift/freshness lag ───────────────► Stale
//!   ├─ conflicting or suspicious evidence ► Suspect
//!   ├─ decisive live-path failure ───────► Broken

//!   ├─ candidate fails, snapshots remain ► DegradedReadOnly
//!   ├─ recovery aborts, no read path ────► Broken
//!   └─ retries exhausted / conflict ─────► Escalate

//! Escalate

//! ```
//!
//! # Authority Boundary
//!
//! - The DB-layer verdict engine classifies evidence into a durability state.
//! - The mailbox supervisor owns exclusive recovery and any supervisor-only
//!   writes while the mailbox is degraded.
//! - The operator owns `Escalate` exit decisions.
//!
//! # Safety Rule
//!
//! Once the mailbox is no longer `Healthy`, no caller may assume direct mutable
//! access to the live SQLite file. All mutating behavior must follow the
//! per-state write policy defined here.
