/// `SQLite` WAL mode allows unlimited concurrent readers but serializes writers.
/// With a 1000-agent workload where ~10% are active simultaneously (~100 concurrent
/// tool calls) and a 3:1 read:write ratio, we need:
///
/// - **Readers**: At least 50 connections so read-heavy tools (`fetch_inbox`,
///   `search_messages`, resources) never queue behind writes.
/// - **Writers**: Only one writer executes at a time in WAL, so extra write
///   connections just queue on the WAL lock — but having a handful avoids
///   pool-acquire contention for the write path.
///
/// Defaults: `min=25, max=100`.  The pool lazily opens connections (starting from
/// `min`), so a lightly-loaded server uses only ~25 connections.  Under load the
/// pool grows up to 100, which still stays well within `SQLite` practical limits.

//
// Synthetic durability canaries exercise the full durability stack (integrity
// probes, archive-drift detection, recovery, write-deferral replay) against
// disposable, isolated mailboxes so regressions surface before they affect
// real operator traffic.
//
// To prevent canary activity from polluting production dashboards, alert
// streams, or aggregate health signals, three isolation layers are defined:
//
// 1. **Namespace convention** — canary projects, agents, and storage roots
//    carry a well-known prefix (`__canary_`) that is trivially filterable in
//    structured logs and SQL queries.
//
// 2. **Metric isolation** — canary probes record into a dedicated
//    `CanaryMetrics` surface (in `mcp_agent_mail_core::metrics`) that is
//    never aggregated into the production `DbMetrics` or `StorageMetrics`
//    counters.
//
// 3. **Alert isolation** — the `CanaryAlertTier` enum classifies every
//    canary event into one of four routing tiers so alerting pipelines can
//    suppress canary failures from paging while still making them visible
//    for debugging.

/// Reserved prefix for all synthetic canary identifiers.
///
/// Any project slug, agent name, or storage-root directory whose name begins
/// with this prefix is treated as canary traffic by the entire durability
/// subsystem.  Production code paths that aggregate health signals, emit
/// alerts, or update operator-facing dashboards **must** exclude identifiers
/// that match [`is_canary_identifier`].
