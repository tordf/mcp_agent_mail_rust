//! Shared test helpers for mcp-agent-mail-db integration tests.
//!
//! Provides a spin-loop `block_on` that correctly drives futures to completion
//! without relying on the asupersync runtime's `thread::park()` mechanism.
//!
//! ## Why not use the runtime?
//!
//! All `SQLite` operations in this crate are synchronous (wrapped in
//! immediately-ready futures).  The asupersync runtime's `block_on` uses
//! `thread::park()` on `Poll::Pending`, which requires a proper waker to
//! `unpark` the thread.  Since no I/O driver or timer is registered with
//! `Cx::for_testing()`, a `Pending` return from internal bookkeeping (pool
//! acquire, `OnceCell` init) would park the thread forever.
//!
//! The spin-loop executor avoids this by repeatedly polling without parking,
//! which is safe because the futures resolve in very few polls (typically 0-1).
