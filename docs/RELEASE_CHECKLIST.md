## Artifact Sanity Checks

Before release, verify test artifacts are consistent and complete:

```bash
# 1. Dual-mode E2E artifacts exist and show 0 failures
ls tests/artifacts/dual_mode/*/run_summary.json
cat tests/artifacts/dual_mode/*/run_summary.json
# e2e_fail must be 0, e2e_pass >= 84

# 2. No failure bundles generated
ls tests/artifacts/dual_mode/*/failures/
# Should be empty (no fail_*.json files)

# 3. Per-step structured logs exist
ls tests/artifacts/dual_mode/*/steps/step_*.json | wc -l
# Should be >= 42 (one per test step)

# 4. Golden snapshot checksums are current
am golden verify
# All checksums must match

# 4b. Native check-inbox command is available
am check-inbox --help
# Compatibility shim fallback (only for native regressions):
# PATH="/data/tmp/cargo-target/release:$PATH" legacy/hooks/check_inbox.sh --help

# 5. Verify-live E2E artifacts exist (native path authoritative)
am e2e run --project . share_verify_live
ls tests/artifacts/share_verify_live/*/case_*/command.txt
ls tests/artifacts/share_verify_live/*/case_*/check_trace.jsonl
# If command unavailable in current binary, suite emits deterministic SKIP with reason

# 6. Golden denial fixtures exist
ls tests/fixtures/golden_snapshots/mcp_deny_*.txt
# At least 5 files (share, guard, doctor, archive, migrate)

# 7. Machine-readable gate report exists and is release-eligible
am ci --report tests/artifacts/ci/gate_report.json
jq '.decision, .release_eligible, .thresholds, (.gates | length)' tests/artifacts/ci/gate_report.json
# decision must be "go", release_eligible must be true, thresholds must have zero failed_gates

# 8. Lag/flash incident gates emit complete artifacts + triage digest
am e2e run --project . tui_full_traversal
LATEST_TUI_RUN="$(ls -td tests/artifacts/tui_full_traversal/*/ | head -1)"
test -f "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/traversal_gate_verdict.json"
test -f "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/flash_detection_report.json"
test -f "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/soak_regression_report.json"
test -f "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/lag_flash_gate_triage.md"
jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/traversal_gate_verdict.json"
jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/flash_detection_report.json"
jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/soak_regression_report.json"
cat "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/lag_flash_gate_triage.md"

# 9. Soak harness trend artifact exists
am e2e run --project . soak_harness
SOAK_TREND="$(find tests/artifacts/perf/soak_harness -type f -name 'perf_timeseries.jsonl' -print -quit)"
test -n "${SOAK_TREND}"
wc -l "${SOAK_TREND}"
```

## Rollout Validation

### Before promoting

1. Run the full CI suite (includes all dual-mode gates):
   ```bash
   am ci --report tests/artifacts/ci/gate_report.json
   ```

   Confirm gate report decision:
   ```bash
   jq '.decision' tests/artifacts/ci/gate_report.json
   # "go" required for promotion
   ```

2. Or run individual gates:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-conformance
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test mode_matrix_harness
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test semantic_conformance
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test perf_security_regressions
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test perf_guardrails
   cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test help_snapshots
   am e2e run --project . dual_mode
   am e2e run --project . mode_matrix
   am e2e run --project . security_privacy
   am e2e run --project . tui_a11y
   am e2e run --project . soak_harness
   am e2e run --project . tui_full_traversal
   ```

   Incident-gate triage on failure:
   ```bash
   LATEST_TUI_RUN="$(ls -td tests/artifacts/tui_full_traversal/*/ | head -1)"
   cat "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/lag_flash_gate_triage.md"
   jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/traversal_gate_verdict.json"
   jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/flash_detection_report.json"
   jq '.all_within_budget, .failing_samples' "${LATEST_TUI_RUN}/soak_regression_report.json"
   ```

3. Manual smoke test:
   ```bash
   # MCP denial gate works:
   mcp-agent-mail share 2>&1        # Should exit 2 with denial message

   # CLI accepts all commands:
   am share --help                  # Should exit 0
   am doctor check --json           # Should exit 0 with JSON output

   # Native deployment validation path:
   am share deploy verify-live https://example.github.io/agent-mail --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle --json > /tmp/verify-live.json
   jq '.verdict, .summary' /tmp/verify-live.json

   # Cloudflare Pages tooling + validation path:
   am share deploy tooling /tmp/agent-mail-bundle
   test -f /tmp/agent-mail-bundle/.github/workflows/deploy-cf-pages.yml
   test -f /tmp/agent-mail-bundle/wrangler.toml.template
   am share deploy verify-live https://example.pages.dev --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle --json > /tmp/verify-live-cf.json
   jq '.verdict, .summary' /tmp/verify-live-cf.json

   # MCP server starts:
   mcp-agent-mail serve --help      # Should exit 0
   ```

4. Start `am` and verify TUI:
   - TUI renders correctly (all 11 screens load)
   - Keybindings respond (Tab, 1-8, ?, q)
   - Command palette opens (Ctrl+P)
   - System Health shows green status

5. Test headless mode:
   ```bash
   mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui &
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
   # Should return 34 tools
   ```

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Signals to Watch (First 24-48 Hours)

| Signal | How to check | Expected range | Action if abnormal |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| MCP denial rate | `grep "not an MCP server command" <logs>` | 0 from agents | Investigate agent config |
| CLI exit codes | Operator workflow logs | Exit 0 for all commands | Check migration guide |
| DB lock contention | `resource://tooling/locks` | No increase from baseline | Check pool sizing |
| Tool latency p95 | `resource://tooling/metrics` | Within baseline SLOs | Profile hot path |
| Disk usage growth | `du -sh ~/.mcp_agent_mail/` | Stable growth rate | Check archive retention |
| Error rate | Application logs | No new error classes | Triage by error type |

### Error Classes to Monitor

| Error class | Severity | Likely cause | Runbook action |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Exit code 2 from agent sessions | High | Agent invoking CLI command on MCP binary | Fix agent config |
| "not an MCP server command" in MCP logs | Medium | Misrouted command | Check binary path in config |
| "database is locked" spike | Medium | Pool exhaustion under new load | Increase pool size |
| Panic/backtrace in denial stderr | Critical | Bug in denial gate | Activate kill-switch |
| CLI command succeeds on MCP binary | Critical | Denial gate bypass | Activate kill-switch immediately |

### Escalation Path

1. **Non-critical:** File a bead, fix in next release
2. **Medium:** Fix within 24 hours, deploy hotfix
3. **High/Critical:** Execute [kill-switch procedure](ROLLOUT_PLAYBOOK.md#4-kill-switch-procedure)

### Monitoring Dashboard Queries

```bash
# Count denial gate hits in last hour
grep -c "not an MCP server command" /var/log/mcp-agent-mail/*.log

# Check for any panics
grep -i "panic\|backtrace" /var/log/mcp-agent-mail/*.log

# Tool latency percentiles (via MCP resource)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"resource://tooling/metrics"}}' \
  | jq '.result.contents[0].text | fromjson | .tools[] | {name, call_count, p95_ms}'

# Active locks
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"resource://tooling/locks"}}' \
  | jq '.result.contents[0].text | fromjson | .summary'
```

## V2 Surface Ownership and Kill-Switch Mapping

| Surface | Activation boundary | Kill-switch action | Primary owner | Secondary owner |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| MCP interface mode | `AM_INTERFACE_MODE` policy + binary separation | Clear CLI mode env and redeploy MCP binary | Runtime owner | Release owner |
| CLI workflows (`am`) | CLI binary rollout ring | Roll back `am` to last-known-good release | CLI owner | Runtime owner |
| TUI console | `TUI_ENABLED=true` and launch profile | Restart with `--no-tui` | TUI owner | Runtime owner |
| Static export pipeline | publish workflow gates | Disable publish jobs and hold exports | Docs/release owner | CLI owner |
| Build slots/worktrees | `WORKTREES_ENABLED=true` only after canary | Set `WORKTREES_ENABLED=false` and restart | Runtime owner | Storage owner |
| Local auth posture | bearer/JWT policy | Re-enable strict auth (`HTTP_ALLOW_LOCALHOST_UNAUTHENTICATED=0`) | Security owner | Runtime owner |

## Incident Rollback Timelines and Communication Paths

| Milestone | Target timeline | Channel | Required payload |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| Incident acknowledged | <= 5 minutes | on-call chat | incident ID, suspected surface, owner |
| Kill-switch decision | <= 10 minutes | incident bridge | go/no-go with rationale |
| Rollback executed | <= 15 minutes | deployment channel | command/runbook step + env scope |
| Operator notice | <= 20 minutes | operator channel + thread | user impact + workaround |
| Evidence bundle posted | <= 60 minutes | bead thread + incident doc | logs, artifacts, reproduction |

## Release Sign-Off Ledger (Required)

Fill one row per phase promotion decision.

### Sign-Off Workflow (Required For Every Promotion)

1. Run full gates and emit report: `am ci --report tests/artifacts/ci/gate_report.json`.
2. Confirm report fields: `decision == "go"` and `release_eligible == true`.
3. Attach at least one artifact link per gate family (correctness, security/privacy, accessibility, performance, determinism).
4. Record owner, UTC timestamp, and rationale in the ledger row for the phase transition.
5. If any threshold fails, mark decision `no-go`, document blocker bead IDs, and do not promote.

### Non-Quick Candidate Cadence (br-3vwi.12.3.3)

Run a **non-quick** gate report at least once every 24 hours during active rollout and within 12 hours before any promotion decision.

```bash
run_ts="$(date -u +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
am ci --report "tests/artifacts/ci/${run_ts}/case_02_report.json"
jq '.decision, .release_eligible, .summary' "tests/artifacts/ci/${run_ts}/case_02_report.json"
```

Latest non-quick artifact snapshot:
- `tests/artifacts/ci/20260213_031050/case_02_report.json`
- `decision="no-go"`, `release_eligible=false`, `summary={total:13, pass:4, fail:9, skip:0}`

Owner rotation (weekly, Monday 00:00 UTC handoff):
| Primary owner | Backup owner | Responsibility |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Release owner | CI maintainer | Run non-quick report, update docs with latest artifact path + verdict, record ledger evidence links |
| CI maintainer | Agent integration lead | Verify report schema/completeness and flag stale artifact age (>24h) |
| Agent integration lead | On-call operator | Confirm rollout thread + bead updates reference latest artifact before promotion |

| Phase | Decision (`go`/`no-go`) | Owner | UTC timestamp | Rationale | Evidence links |
|------|--------------------------|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Phase 0 -> Phase 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Phase 1 -> Phase 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Phase 2 (25% -> 50%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Phase 2 (50% -> 100%) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Phase 3 (GA confirmation) |  |  |  |  |  |
